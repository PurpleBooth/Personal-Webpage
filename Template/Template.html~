    	<p>I'm William Booth, a final year Computer Science student at Aberystwyth University. I have just completed a Year in Industry at <a href="http://www.gradwell.com/">Gradwell</a>. There I got an opportunity to put into practice a number of things I have been learning about Test Driven Development, project planning, Distributed Version Control systems, and a lot of cool stuff about VoIP.</p>
		<p>On this website you can, find links to some of my favourite video lectures on these topics, as well as intersting papers, and resources. You can also have at some solutions I have written to solve some Programming Praxis.</p>
